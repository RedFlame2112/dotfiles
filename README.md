## SYSTEM_LOADOUT

My personal Arch Linux and Hyprland environment. 
I themed this after Silver Wolf from Honkai: Star rail, who is my favorite character!

| Component | Configuration |
| --- | --- |
| Window manager | Hyprland |
| Terminal | Kitty + Powerlevel10k |
| Shell | Zsh + Oh My Zsh |
| Editor | Neovim 0.12, tracked as a submodule |
| Launcher | Rofi |
| Notifications | Dunst |
| Lock screen | Swaylock |
| System bar | Waybar / Wayle |
| Package layer | Arch packages + Home Manager |

## FEATURES

- Deny-by-default Git tracking so caches, credentials, history, cookies, logs,
  and machine state stay out of the repository.
- A modern Neovim environment with native LSP, completion, Treesitter, DAP,
  Conform formatting, Flash navigation, TODO navigation, and Codex workflows.
- Styled Hyprland, Rofi, Dunst, Kitty, Fastfetch, and Waybar themes.
- Deduplicated shell PATH with conditional initialization for Nix, pyenv, Conda,
  opam, Cargo, and project tooling.
- Home Manager packages and utility scripts, including curated configuration
  backups and repeatable validation.

## INSTALL_SEQUENCE

> [!WARNING]
> Review the repository before checkout. These files target Arch Linux and can
> replace existing configuration in your home directory.

```bash
git clone --bare https://github.com/RedFlame2112/dotfiles.git "$HOME/dotfiles"

git --git-dir="$HOME/dotfiles" \
  --work-tree="$HOME" \
  checkout

git --git-dir="$HOME/dotfiles" \
  --work-tree="$HOME" \
  submodule update --init --recursive

exec zsh
```

If checkout reports conflicting files, back them up first and retry. The
repository intentionally does not automate destructive replacement.

## SUTURE_BOOTSTRAP // ARCH LINUX

Suture is the emerging repeatable setup path for this configuration. After the
base checkout above, it reads the tracked package manifest and presents an Arch
package plan before installing anything. It is Arch-only for now; NixOS support
will be added separately.

> [!NOTE]
> Suture is currently a private companion repository. This path is available to
> collaborators with access; it will become a fully public bootstrap once the
> Suture release repository is published. The command below deliberately pins a
> tested release instead of installing an unreviewed development branch.

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed git go base-devel

go install github.com/RedFlame2112/suture/cmd/suture@v0.5.0
export PATH="$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH"

suture doctor
suture plan
suture bootstrap
```

`suture bootstrap` currently validates the local toolchain and applies the
package manifest, prompting for confirmation. It does not use `--prune`, so it
will not remove unmanaged packages. Review the plan carefully: AUR packages
run user-submitted build scripts through `paru` or `yay`. The bare checkout and
Home Manager activation remain manual steps until the installer workflow lands.

## COMMAND_DECK

The `dots` alias targets the bare repository while leaving `$HOME` as the live
work tree:

```bash
dots status
dots add ~/.zshrc ~/.config/hypr/userprefs.conf
dots commit -m "Tune the system"
dots push
```

Update the Neovim submodule independently, then record its new revision:

```bash
git -C ~/.config/nvim pull
dots add ~/.config/nvim
dots commit -m "Update Neovim submodule"
dots push
```

Run available configuration checks with:

```bash
dotfiles-check
```

```

## SECURITY_PROTOCOL

Only hand-authored preferences are tracked. Electron application history,
browser storage, authentication databases, caches, generated logs, and machine
identifiers are excluded. Secrets should live in a password manager, system
keyring, or ignored environment file—never directly in these configs.
